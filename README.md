<h3>Basic HTML Website</h3> 

<p>In this project, I was required to create a simple HTML only website with multiple pages. </p>


<p>The requirements for the website are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating multiple pages in a website: Homepage, Projects, Articles, Contact.</li>
<li>Having a navigation bar that should be present on all pages and link to all the pages.</li>
<li>Styling the website is not needed, just structuring the website using HTML.</li>
<li>Adding SEO meta tags to the website.</li>
</ul>
